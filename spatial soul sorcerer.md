# Spatial Soul Sorcerer

Some attribute the acquisition of this magic to exposure to teleportation magic before birth, others link it to a connection with extradimensional spaces, and others still believe this magic is actually from a psychic disconnect with the material world. Whatever the true source may be, you are gifted with powers of teleportation that even archmages can only envy.

The Nature of your Sorcerous Origin has bestowed upon you any number of following optional quirks - none of which can be done voluntarily: 
| Spatial Soul Sorcerer Quirks |
| :---         |   
| You teleport randomly in your sleep, safely, always within the same room or within 10 feet of where you started. You always wake right where you fell asleep. |
| You teleport unattended items within a foot of your hand into your grasp unintentionally, when you were going to just pick them up. |
| You can't help but teleport coins from your pouch directly into your hand when giving them to others. |
| When bored, you make small objects in your hand vanish, then reappear moments later. You don't know where they are teleported to and from. |
| You sometimes talk to yourself, teleporting a few feet back and forth as you hold both sides of the conversation. |

### Warp Magic:
You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Warp Magic table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a conjuration or divination spell from the Wizard, Warlock or Sorcerer spell lists. 

##### Warp Magic Table:

| Sorcerer Level | Spell 1 | Spell 2 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | Shield | Longstrider |
| 3 | Misty Step | Vortex Warp |
| 5 | Blink | Thunder Step |
| 7 | Dimension Door | Freedom of Movement |
| 9 | Far Step | Steel Wind Strike |

### Blink Away
_1st Level Spatial Soul Feature_

You can instantly teleport to a slightly different location in response to pain. When you are damaged by an attack or a harmful effect, you can use your reaction to teleport yourself 5 feet away from the source of the damage to an unoccupied space you can see. If there is no unoccupied space within 5 feet, you teleport to the nearest unoccupied space you can see that you did not teleport from.
Additionally, you can use this feature to gain advantage on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid damage. If you succeed on the saving throw, you take no damage and if you fail, you take only half damage. Once you have used this feature to gain advantage on a dexterity saving throw you cannot use any part of this feature again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot to cast a spell that teleports you.

### Flash Dash
_1st Level Spatial Soul Feature_

When you use an action to Dash, you can teleport 10 feet in your intended direction (as long as you can see that space and it is available for you to occupy) before continuing with the normal Dash distance. If you are grappled or restrained using this feature costs 1 Sorcery Point. 

### Spatial Breach
_6th Level Spatial Soul Feature_

You gain the ability to create portals, linking two places in space to one another.

As an action you can duplicate the effect of the [Arcane Gate](https://imgur.com/ya5lJhz) spell without using a spell slot, but with the following limitations:
- The range is 90 feet instead of 500 feet.
- The duration is 1 minute (concentration) instead of 10 minutes (concentration).
- Once placed these portals cannot be rotated.
- Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you take a long rest. Alternatively you may spend 5 sorcery points to regain use of this feature.

### Practiced Far Step:
_14th Level Spatial Soul Feature_

You can cast Misty Step and Vortex Warp without expending Spell Slots. 

At 18th Level this feature extends to Dimension Door (provided you target only yourself).

### Gatekeeper:
_18th Level Spatial Soul Feature_

While you are conscious you emit a 40 foot aura that disrupts any unauthorized teleportation. 
When a creature attempts to teleport or is targeted by a teleportation effect while within this aura the source of the teleportation must make a charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the teleportation fails and any spell slots or resources used in the attempt are consumed. On a success the teleportation proceeds as normal. Additionally, teleporting into this aura is impossible and any attempt to do so automatically fails. Creatures of your choosing may ignore any number of this auraâ€™s effects. 

### Optional advice for Roleplaying a Spatial Soul:
As a Spatial Soul, you embody the essence of constant movement and the manipulation of space itself. Your innate connection to teleportation and portals means you're always on the move, whether by choice or circumstance. Your life is a series of fleeting moments in countless locations, making you a natural wanderer. Embrace the unpredictability of your existence, often speaking of places far and wide with a sense of longing or nostalgia. Your interactions may reflect a desire to experience new horizons or a reluctance to form deep attachments, knowing you may not stay long. 

When casting spells, think of ways you can tie it into your transportative powers. Fireball becomes a portal to the elemental plane of fire. Instead of Shield functioning as a physical shield, perhaps you teleport your attacker or their projectile a few feet to the side. Small things like this will really make this subclass come alive.
