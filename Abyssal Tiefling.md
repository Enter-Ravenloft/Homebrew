## Tiefling (Abyssal)
* **Ability Scores:** Cha +2; Con +1
* **Size:** Medium
* **Speed:** 30 ft.
* **Age.** Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.
* **Size.** Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.
* **Darkvision.** Thanks to your abyssal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
* **Abyssal Resistance.** Each time you finish a long rest, you gain resistance to a random damage type. At the end of each long rest, you lose the resistance previously granted by this feature. You replace that resistance by rolling for a new one on the Abyssal  Fortitude table. If you roll the same resistance you gained at the end of your previous long rest, roll again until you get a different result.
* **Legacy of the Abyss.** Each time you finish a long rest, you gain the ability to cast cantrips and spells randomly determined from a short list. At 1st level, you can cast a cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast a 1st-level spell. At 5th level, you can cast a 2nd-level spell.<br><br>
You can cast a spell gained from this trait only once until you complete your next long rest. You can cast a cantrip gained from this trait at will, as normal. For 1st-level spells whose effect changes if cast using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you cast the spell as if using a 2nd-level slot. Spells of 2nd level are cast as if using a 2nd-level slot.<br><br>
At the end of each long rest, you lose the cantrips and spells previously granted by this feature, even if you did not cast them. You replace those cantrips and spells by rolling for new ones on the Abyssal Arcana Spells table. Roll separately for each cantrip and spell. If you roll the same spell or cantrip you gained at the end of your previous long rest, roll again until you get a different result.<br><br>
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.<br><br>
* **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Abyssal.
