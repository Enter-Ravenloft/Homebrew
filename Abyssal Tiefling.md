## Tiefling (Abyssal)
* **Ability Scores:** Cha +2; Con +1
* **Size:** Medium
* **Speed:** 30 ft.
* **Age.** Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.
* **Size.** Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.
* **Darkvision.** Thanks to your abyssal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
* **Abyssal Resistance.** Each time you finish a long rest, you gain resistance to a random damage type. At the end of each long rest, you lose the resistance previously granted by this feature. You replace that resistance by rolling for a new one on the Abyssal  Fortitude table. If you roll the same resistance you gained at the end of your previous long rest, roll again until you get a different result.
