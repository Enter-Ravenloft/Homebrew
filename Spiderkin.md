# Spiderkin
The spiderkin are a race unknown to most, if not all, of the world. They hide deep in the Underdark and only leave in dire emergencies. The occasional drow that discovers their society will find that they will never leave.
### Thin and Secretive
Spiderkin have an extra set of eyes, dark and faded skin colors, four limbs that end darker and hairier then the rest of their bodies. Besides those features, they are fairly similar to humans in appearance. They use this to their advantage whenever they leave their society, wearing covering clothes to pass of as a human or a drow. They stand between 4 to 5 feet tall and are very thin. They tend to keep most of what they know a secret, being that they do not trust others not of their kind.

Their secluded nature makes them very antisocial, only feeling open when they are around their own kind or if they know an idividual well enough that they can feel comfortable around them. This also prevents people of other cultures from learning the origins of their race and city location.
