# Pugilist Enhancements
*Weapon*

### Description
Creatures with natural weapons or unarmed strikes can augment their *untransformed* body (transformed Bloodhunters, Wildshaped Druids etc cannot wield these weapons) with Pugilist Enhancements.

- The damage and damage type of this weapon matches your usual unarmed or natural weapon damage, however pugilist enhancements can benefit from weapon enchantments, crafting from special materials etc.
- The +1 to hit and damage provided by Eldritch Claw tattoo and Insignia of Claws do not stack with Pugilist Enhancements.
- Claws & Fists are considered "held items" for the purposes of interacting with objects, grappling etc. Pugilist Enhancements on tails, bites, or other non-claw and non-fist natural weapons are not "held items."

**Unarmed.** Weapons with the Unarmed property can be used to make unarmed attacks. A player must use an object interaction to wield or un-wield an unarmed weapon.
