## College of the Dancer (Enter Ravenloft)
:
To be a Bard is to create. To create art and evoke emotion within those who perceive it. Music is powerful in this way, as music has the ability to communicate emotion and power to any creature that hears it so if one were to embody music, their form would carry that innate magic, would it not? This is the philosophy shared by Bards of the College of the Dancer.

### Dancer's Poise
A College of the Dancer is considered to be ***Poised*** if their movement speed is not 0, they are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield. While ***Poised*** you can only use weapons with the finesse property.

### Warding Beauty
Upon taking this archetype at 3rd level, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield. 

### Dance Arcanum
Also beginning at 3rd level, you move with the grace of the *Dance Arcanum.*

While you are ***Poised***, your Bard spells do not need verbal or material components without a cost, as long as the spell also has a somatic component.

Additionally, you learn to create unique magical effects with your dances. You can choose a number of Dances equal to your Profiency Bonus when you complete a long rest -- those are the Dances you have available until you complete a Long Rest and choose a new selection of dances. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration while ***Poised*** to create one of the following effects:

##### Blade Dance
Your dance evokes the elegance and hostility of the mighty Viper. If a creature makes a melee attack against you, regardless of if they hit or miss, you may make a single weapon attack against that creature as a reaction. When making this attack, you roll your Bardic Inspiration Die and add the value rolled to either your attack roll or that attack's damage.

##### Fire Dance
You evoke the power of your raw personality and impose it upon the world. As a part of a Spell Attack, you may expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration, rolling your Bardic Inspiration Die and adding the value rolled to one damage roll of the spell.

##### Shield Dance
You embody the power of your muse. As a bonus action, you strike a pose of confidence and power, rolling your Bardic Inspiration Die and granting yourself temporary hit points equal to the value rolled. You lose these temporary hit points at the end of your next turn.

##### Alluring Dance
You embody the elegance and beauty of music momentarily. As an action, you may expend a Bardic Inspiration Die, forcing a single creature of your choice within 30 feet of that can see you to make a Wisdom Saving throw against your Bard spell save DC. On a failure, the target creature is *Charmed* by you until the end of your next turn.

##### Wind Dance
You lighten your steps, increasing the efficiency of your stride. As a bonus action, you may expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration to dash, dodge, disengage or help.

### Dazzling Confidence
Beginning at 6th level, the power of your personality radiates forth and influences those around you. You learn to impose your personality on the world around you in new ways.

As an action, while you are ***Poised***, you can create one of the following magical effects which lasts for one minute. The effect ends if you become incapacitated or are no longer ***Poised***.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.


##### Heroes' Waltz
You begin to dance, radiating an aura of certainty and safety. For the next minute, every time you or a friendly creature within 15 feet of you needs to make a saving throw, they may add your Charisma modifier to that saving throw. The creature must be able to see you and your dance for this bonus to apply.

##### War Dance
Your dance is violent and evocative of destruction and fury. For the next minute, the first weapon attack a friendly creature within 15 feet of you makes each turn deals extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier. The creature must be able to see you and your dance for this bonus to apply.

### Dance Together
Beginning at 14th level, you have mastered the art of your dance to such an extent that you can impart that knowledge on others. When you use one of your Dance Arcanum features, you may select a creature within 30 feet of you to dance with you, able to use that dance maneuver once any time within the next minute.

### Crowd Pleaser
Also beginning at 14th level, you have learned to draw power from your audience. For every friendly creature within 15 feet of you, you add +1 to your Bardic Inspiration Dice rolls, to a maximum of +3. (For example, if you have 3 friendly creatures within 15 feet of you, your Bardic Inspiration Die becomes 1d10 + 3, or 1d12 + 3 as of 15th level.)
